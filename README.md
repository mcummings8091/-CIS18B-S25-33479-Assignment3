Hello! This program is a simple program meant as an excercise in incorporating the Oberver and Decorator design patterns. The Observer is mounted to the BankAccount class and is used to monitor transactions! The Decorator pattern is used to elevate an account and make it more secure! (Adding a withdrawl limit, and pin requirement for account actions.)
